## üíª Local Setup

### Backend

- Navigate into the backend directory `cd backend`
- Set up Postgres DATABASE_URL in .env. You can get a free PostgreSQL connection string from [Aiven.io](https://aiven.io/).
- Set up Prisma connection pool DATABASE_URL in wrangler.toml file. You can get this for free from [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/data-platform/accelerate).
- Set up JWT Secret JWT_SECRET in wrangler.toml file. This can be any value.
- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Run the application locally using `npm run dev`

> Note: wrangler.toml is the environment configuration file for a serverless backend. .env is used by Prisma for connection pooling. Ensure you configure both environment files accordingly.

### Frontend

- Navigate into the frontend directory using `cd frontend`
- Install dependencies using `npm install`
- Run the application locally using `npm run dev`

### AI based Article content generation
- set `FF_ENABLE_AI` = true in config.ts
- set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in wrangler.toml file in the backend.
